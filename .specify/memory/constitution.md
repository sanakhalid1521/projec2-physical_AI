### Hands-on First Learning
Every lesson must start with a hands-on activity that demonstrates the concept; learners build first, then understand theory through practice; practical examples take precedence over abstract explanations

### Progressive Difficulty
Content must follow a clear progression from beginner to intermediate level; each lesson builds on previous concepts with increasing complexity; prerequisite knowledge clearly stated for each module

### Simple Language
Technical concepts explained using clear, accessible language; avoid heavy mathematics and complex jargon; prioritize intuitive understanding over theoretical rigor

### Bilingual Support
Content must be available in both English (primary) and Urdu (optional) languages; one-click translation per lesson; ensure accessibility for diverse learners

### User-aware Learning
Content must adapt to user background and progress; users can sign up and log in to personalize their learning experience; learning paths customized based on user interactions

### Docusaurus Platform Standard
All content delivered through Docusaurus platform; consistent styling, navigation, and user experience; leverage Docusaurus features for optimal learning experience

### Modular Content
Content organized in independent, self-contained modules; each lesson has clear objectives and hands-on activities; modular design allows for extensibility and customization

## Technology and Platform Constraints
Platform restricted to Docusaurus only; authentication via Better-Auth only; no heavy mathematical content; content designed for beginner to intermediate learners; bilingual support (English primary, Urdu optional); modular, extensible architecture required

## Content Development Process
Every lesson must have clear objectives and hands-on activities; content reviewed for accessibility and practical application; iterative development based on learner feedback; both English and Urdu versions maintained simultaneously; user authentication and personalization features implemented

## Governance
Constitution governs all project decisions; amendments require explicit approval; all content must align with hands-on learning approach; regular review for consistency with core principles
