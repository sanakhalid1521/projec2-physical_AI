# Embodied AI Concepts

Embodied AI is the idea that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. Unlike traditional AI that processes abstract data, embodied AI must deal with the physical constraints of the real world.

## The Embodiment Hypothesis

The embodiment hypothesis suggests that the form and physical properties of an agent play a crucial role in its intelligence. This means:
- Physical form influences cognitive processes
- Intelligence is shaped by environmental interactions
- Sensory-motor coordination is fundamental to cognition

## Key Principles

### Morphological Computation
The idea that the physical form of a robot can simplify computational problems. For example, the shape of a robot's foot can make balance easier to achieve.

### Affordances
The relationship between an object's properties and the actions it permits. A handle affords grasping, a ramp affords climbing.

### Grounded Cognition
Cognitive processes are grounded in sensory and motor experiences, not abstract symbols.

## Hands-On Activity

Think of three examples from your daily life where the physical form of an object makes a task easier. For instance, the curved handle of a cup makes it easier to hold. Document these examples and explain how the form simplifies the interaction.
