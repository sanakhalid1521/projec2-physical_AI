# Feedback and Control

Feedback control is essential for humanoid robots to perform tasks accurately and maintain stability. It allows robots to adjust their behavior based on sensory information about their current state and the environment.

## Control System Fundamentals

### Open-Loop vs. Closed-Loop Control
- Open-loop: Control without feedback (no correction for errors)
- Closed-loop: Control with feedback (errors are detected and corrected)

### PID Control
Proportional-Integral-Derivative control is a fundamental control technique:
- Proportional: Responds to current error
- Integral: Responds to accumulated past error
- Derivative: Responds to rate of error change

## Stability and Performance

### Stability
A control system is stable if it returns to equilibrium after a disturbance. For humanoid robots, stability is crucial for balance and safe operation.

### Performance Metrics
- Rise time: How quickly the system responds
- Overshoot: How much the system exceeds the target
- Settling time: How long to reach steady state
- Steady-state error: Error after settling

## Advanced Control Concepts

### Adaptive Control
Control systems that adjust their parameters based on changing conditions or system properties.

### Robust Control
Control systems designed to work well despite uncertainties in the model or disturbances.

## Hands-On Activity

Create a simple simulation of a PID controller for maintaining a robot's balance. Consider a simplified model where the robot needs to maintain an upright position by adjusting its ankle torques based on body angle measurements.

Implement the three components (P, I, D) and experiment with different parameter values to see how they affect the system's response.
