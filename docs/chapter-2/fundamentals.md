# Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals

Humanoid robotics is a specialized field that focuses on creating robots with human-like characteristics, both in form and function. These robots are designed to interact with human environments and potentially work alongside humans.

## Anatomy of Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots typically feature:
- Bipedal locomotion systems
- Anthropomorphic body structure
- Multi-fingered hands for manipulation
- Head with sensors for perception
- Upper and lower body coordination

## Key Challenges

Designing effective humanoid robots involves addressing:
- Balance and stability during movement
- Complex motor control for natural motion
- Human-robot interaction and communication
- Energy efficiency for sustained operation
