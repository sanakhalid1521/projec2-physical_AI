# Motor Control Systems

Motor control systems in humanoid robots are responsible for generating the appropriate commands to actuators to achieve desired movements. This involves complex coordination of multiple joints and consideration of the robot's dynamics.

## Control Hierarchies

### High-Level Planning
- Trajectory planning
- Task sequencing
- Goal-oriented behavior

### Mid-Level Control
- Inverse kinematics
- Motion generation
- Balance control

### Low-Level Control
- Joint servo control
- Torque control
- Feedback regulation

## Control Approaches

### Model-Based Control
Using mathematical models of the robot's dynamics to compute control commands. Requires accurate models but can achieve precise control.

### Learning-Based Control
Using machine learning techniques to learn control policies. Can adapt to model inaccuracies but requires training data.

### Hybrid Approaches
Combining model-based and learning-based methods to leverage the strengths of both.

## Hands-On Activity

Design a simple control system for moving a robot arm from one point to another. Consider the following steps:
1. Plan the trajectory (path planning)
2. Calculate joint angles needed (inverse kinematics)
3. Generate control commands to actuators
4. Implement feedback control to correct errors

Sketch out the control loop and identify where feedback would be used to improve performance.
