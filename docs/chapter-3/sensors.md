# Sensor Integration & Perception

Robots must perceive their environment to operate effectively in the physical world. Sensor integration is crucial for enabling robots to understand and interact with their surroundings.

## Types of Sensors

Common robotic sensors include:
- Vision systems (cameras, depth sensors)
- Tactile sensors for touch feedback
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
- Force and torque sensors
- Proximity sensors
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity)

## Perception Systems

Effective perception involves:
- Sensor fusion to combine multiple data sources
- Real-time processing of sensor data
- Object recognition and scene understanding
- Spatial mapping and localization
