# AI Decision Making & Learning

Artificial intelligence enables robots to make autonomous decisions and learn from their experiences. This capability distinguishes advanced robots from simple automated machines.

## Decision Making Systems

Robots employ various AI approaches for decision making:
- Rule-based systems for predictable scenarios
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior
- Planning algorithms for goal-oriented actions

## Learning Capabilities

Robots can learn through:
- Supervised learning from demonstrations
- Unsupervised learning to discover patterns
- Reinforcement learning through environmental feedback
- Transfer learning to apply knowledge across tasks
