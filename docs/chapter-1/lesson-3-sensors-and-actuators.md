# Sensors and Actuators

Sensors and actuators form the interface between a robot and its environment. Sensors provide input about the world, while actuators provide the ability to act upon it.

## Types of Sensors

### Proprioceptive Sensors
- Encoders: Measure joint angles
- Force/torque sensors: Measure forces applied to the robot
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs): Measure acceleration and rotation

### Exteroceptive Sensors
- Cameras: Visual information
- LIDAR: Distance measurements using light
- Ultrasonic sensors: Distance measurements using sound
- Tactile sensors: Touch and pressure information

## Types of Actuators

### Electric Actuators
- Servo motors: Precise position control
- Stepper motors: Discrete position control
- DC motors: Continuous rotation with variable speed

### Other Actuators
- Hydraulic: High force, precise control
- Pneumatic: Fast response, clean operation

## Hands-On Activity

Research and compare the specifications of different actuators for a humanoid robot's knee joint. Consider factors like:
- Torque requirements
- Speed capabilities
- Power consumption
- Size and weight constraints

Create a simple table comparing at least 3 different actuator options for the knee joint, including their pros and cons for humanoid applications.
