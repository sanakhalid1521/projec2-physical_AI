# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital environments, Physical AI focuses on intelligent systems that interact with, understand, and manipulate the physical world.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI encompasses systems that:
- Perceive their physical environment through sensors
- Reason about physical interactions and constraints
- Execute actions in the real world through actuators
- Learn from physical experiences and interactions

## Applications

Physical AI has applications in:
- Robotics and automation
- Autonomous vehicles
- Smart manufacturing
- Healthcare and assistive technologies
- Environmental monitoring and remediation
