# Control Systems & Actuation

Control systems are the nervous system of robots, enabling precise movement and interaction with the environment. Actuation provides the physical force needed to execute actions.

## Control Architecture

Robotic control systems typically include:
- High-level planning and decision making
- Mid-level trajectory generation
- Low-level motor control
- Feedback control loops for stability

## Actuation Technologies

Common actuation methods include:
- Electric motors and servo systems
- Hydraulic systems for high force applications
- Pneumatic actuators for lightweight solutions
- Advanced materials like shape memory alloys
