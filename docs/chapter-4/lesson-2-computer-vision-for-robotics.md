# Computer Vision for Robotics

Computer vision enables humanoid robots to interpret visual information from their environment. This is crucial for navigation, object manipulation, human interaction, and environmental understanding.

## Core Computer Vision Tasks

### Object Detection and Recognition
- Identifying objects in the environment
- Classifying objects into known categories
- Estimating object poses and sizes
- Critical for manipulation and navigation

### Scene Understanding
- Segmenting different parts of the environment
- Understanding spatial relationships
- Identifying navigable areas
- Recognizing surfaces and obstacles

### Human Detection and Tracking
- Detecting humans in the environment
- Tracking human movements and poses
- Understanding human intentions
- Essential for safe human-robot interaction

## Vision for Navigation

### Obstacle Detection
- Identifying static and dynamic obstacles
- Estimating distances to obstacles
- Planning safe paths around obstacles
- Real-time updates for dynamic environments

### Visual SLAM
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
- Building maps while localizing
- Visual-inertial fusion for robustness
- Essential for autonomous navigation

## Vision for Manipulation

### Object Pose Estimation
- Determining precise position and orientation
- Critical for accurate grasping
- Handling occlusions and clutter
- Real-time pose tracking

### Grasp Planning
- Identifying good grasp points on objects
- Planning approach trajectories
- Considering object properties and stability
- Adapting to object variations

## Deep Learning in Vision

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Powerful for image classification and detection
- Require large training datasets
- Can be computationally intensive
- Good for complex recognition tasks

### Real-Time Considerations
- Balancing accuracy with speed
- Efficient network architectures
- Edge computing for real-time performance
- Power consumption in mobile robots

## Hands-On Activity

Research different approaches to object detection for robotics applications. Compare traditional computer vision methods (like template matching or feature-based detection) with deep learning approaches (like YOLO or Faster R-CNN). Consider factors like accuracy, speed, computational requirements, and adaptability to new objects. Create a comparison table highlighting the trade-offs between different approaches for humanoid robot applications.
